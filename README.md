1 Read all four of the Multitasking Resources in resources.

2 Read both of the Arduino Tone Resources in resources. Pay particular attention to section Code 3: Generating a sound with a button and Code 4: Sounds depending on different keys in the second resource.

3 Build the circuit described in section Code 4: Sounds depending on different keys of the second Arduino Tone Resource in resources and verify that it works properly.

Illumaphone: Light-based Musical Instrument with Arduino

Coke Piano and Launchpad
This project is sort of a two-in-one: two different applications that are based on the same concept. The gist of it is that you hook up a dozen or so aluminum cans to an Arduino, and each can produces a different sound or clip when touched.
