This is my concept proposal for the final project.

I am planning to build a prototype of the interactive lighting system at a city on a small scale.
The lights will change the brightness when it detects a moving thing coming by. the closer the brighter, the farter the daker.
I need to buld a small scale of the city with lights that contraled by light resistor, distance sensor and interactived with mini cars.
Ideally I will also need a display to show the data that from those sensors. For the data, I need to design the visualization to reflect the traffic.The scale of the city will be based on CCA SF campus in 5 blocks, included freeways, living neighborhood and working neighborhood.
