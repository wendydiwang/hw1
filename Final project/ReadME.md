## This is my concept proposal for the final project.

I am planning to build a prototype of the interactive lighting system at a city on a small scale.
The lights will change the brightness when it detects a moving thing coming by. the closer the brighter, the farter the daker.
I need to buld a small scale of the city with #### lights that contraled by  #### light resistor,  #### distance sensor and interactived with  #### mini cars.
Ideally I will also need a display to show the data that from those sensors. For the data, I need to design the visualization to reflect the traffic.The scale of the city will be based on CCA SF campus in 5 blocks, included freeways, living neighborhood and working neighborhood.

 I have 6 weeks and 5 classes for this project before it's due.(April 27)
 the next week 
 
 ### Thursday, March 16, 2017
#### Start working: Research, mock-ups, test ideas and concepts.
 
#### Research:
 1.Find the code for arduino that make multiple tasks.
 2.Related sensors and order it.
 (I have 5 distance sensors and 10 light resistors, if every block need 4 lights I will need 100 sensors. if every sensor control 4 lights I will need 20 sensors....so expensive! ). 
 3.The material I may use. 
 
#### Mock-ups:
 test with 10 lights on 5 senses, see how is the effect.
 
 Decide the size of this prototype.
