this is the instrument I made for digital electronic class,
I use two different sensors: one distance sensor and one potentiometer.

I use processing make some syllables and throuh differenct sensor values to recombine them.
the music is from Yann Tiersen's - La valse d'Amelie.
Enjoy 

1.Draw a sketch of your instrument.

2.Describe the overall concept.
3.Create a very rough schematic to the best of your ability.

    the overall concept is to make a Hemisphere shape touch instrument with different sensors.
    when the user approaches, they can trigger notes on a Whole-note scale by touching the surface. 

    This instrument will have 3 different part:

      the touch(tone):
          the Hemisphere has partition into  3 circles, each circle has partition into 7 parts, each part repersent a tone,
          use your finger touching the are(keys?)a to trigger a sound in a specific tone


          circle1:  circles2:  circles3:
           C1         C2         C3
           D1         D2         D3
           E1         E2         E3
           F1         F2         F3
           G1         G2         G3
           A1         A2         A3
           B1         B2         B3

        the motion(light):
          Use your finger crossed the surface direct results to have the smooth changes of sound.

        the distance from center:
          close to the surface direct results to have the different value of sound.
          
          
4.Describe what your program will do, to the best of your ability.
  
 This instrument will make an ambiance style music, for performance art or tea ceremony.
 Idealy the hardware itself will make good sound. 
 But if it can't, I will need to use the hardware connect to a sound editing software and sound files to make it sounds nice and interactive.
