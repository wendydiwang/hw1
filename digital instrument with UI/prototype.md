In this project, I coded 16 movements in 3 instruments from 'the cloud atlas end title' and Yann Tierson's 'La valse d'Amelie'.
You can recombine the different movements/ within different instruments effect to create a new song or symphony with your free hands.
The process just like we playing music, or conducting an orchestra.
